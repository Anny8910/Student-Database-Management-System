# Student-Database-Management-System

Problem Statement: The system will have a GUI for user interaction and backend database (MySQL). The system will allow user to insert student information in database and search student details


In this, our approach is to utilize the powerful database management, data retrieval and data manipulation.
We have made GUI for user interaction and used MySQL for storing database of student details. 
In this project the admin will login through username and password and can add,search,remove,update any studentâ€™s details and also print the result of any student.
